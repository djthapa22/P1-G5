# P1-G5: Crime and Neighborhood Value analysis in Minneapolis Neighborhood

**Overview:**

Motor vehicle theft in Minneapolis has been on the rise since 2020 and a slow down is not in sight; over 700 cars were stolen in Minneapolis in January 2023. Knowing where this crime occurs frequently is useful when determining if an area is safe to live in or visit.




<ins>Methodology:</ins>

Our group had filtered the two datasets Minneapolis Property Assessor Value and Minneapolis crime count to see if there was a meaningful relationship between Average Neighborhood Value per unit (Per Unit Value) and Crime Count Types.


<ins>Analysis and Findings:</ins>

In our Analysis document,linked below, we outline our findings and further filter for our ideal two neighborhoods.
